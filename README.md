# PPG_photoplethysmography-data-repository-for-estimating-blood-glucose-levels

## Repository Description
This database contains recordings of photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals acquired from 23 subjects of varying age, sex, and glucose levels. The signals were obtained from the forehead, ear, and index finger.
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a validation tool to contribute to developments related to the use of these signals in estimating blood glucose levels.

## Study data
Data were obtained using the photoplethysmography (PPG) reflection method, recording signals from the forehead, ear, and index finger of 23 subjects.

## Description of Subjects
The signals of 23 subjects (11 women and 12 men) ranging in age from 21 to 72 years, respectively, were analyzed. Additionally, notes regarding subject characteristics (age, gender, blood glucose level) were recorded. Detailed information on each subject is presented in the file Characteristics_Glucose_Subjects .xlsx. 
the information related to each topic is summarized as follows:

·Subject: Name of the record associated with each individual, 'Subj_##" (where ## is each subject's number).

·Age: A range of age ranging from 21 years old to a maximum of 72 years old 

·Gender: Male or Female, "M" if male and "F" female 

·Diabetic: Yes, for the one who is diabetic and not, for the one who is not 

·Type of diabetes: Diabetic, Prediabetic and Not applicable 

**Note:** To improve the reader experience, a Markdown file called Glucose_Information.md has been added, which allows for quick viewing of the data table.

## Blood glucose
Glucose is a 6-carbon structure with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Carbohydrates are ubiquitous energy sources for all organisms in the world and are essential for fueling aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration in simple and complex molecular forms [1]. Therefore, their role in energy production and their importance for various daily bodily functions are crucial for maintaining healthy blood glucose levels.

Although the body requires moderate amounts of glucose, the presence of excessively high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia) levels in the blood can significantly increase the risk of serious health complications, leading to a life-threatening disorder called diabetic coma that causes loss of consciousness.

## Data format
This dataset contains .CSV files.

.CSV files are text files with comma-separated data that allow for various functions such as storage, compatibility, simplicity, and efficiency. The CSV format allows you to save lists and tables of any length, and can also be read in Excel, among other things, making it an excellent choice for a repository.

## Database Description
The database uploaded to this repository consists of:
- Folder 1: PPG records
- Folder 2: Age, gender, and blood glucose level characteristics by subject
- Excel file: Excel file with relevant data from the 23 subjects
- Glucose_info: Excel table with glucose characteristics by subject with quick display
