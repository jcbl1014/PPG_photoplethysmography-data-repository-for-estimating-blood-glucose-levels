## Study data
Data were obtained using the photoplethysmography (PPG) reflection method, recording signals from the forehead, ear, and index finger of 23 subjects.

## Description of Subjects
The signals of 23 subjects (11 women and 12 men) ranging in age from 21 to 72 years, respectively, were analyzed. Additionally, notes regarding subject characteristics (age, gender, blood glucose level) were recorded. Detailed information on each subject is presented in the file Characteristics_Glucose_Subjects .xlsx. 
the information related to each topic is summarized as follows:

·Subject: Name of the record associated with each individual, 'Subj_##" (where ## is each subject's number).

·Age: A range of age ranging from 21 years old to a maximum of 72 years old 

·Gender: Male or Female, "M" if male and "F" female 

·Diabetic: Yes, for the one who is diabetic and not, for the one who is not 

·Type of diabetes: Diabetic, Prediabetic and Not applicable 

**Note:** To improve the reader experience, a Markdown file called Glucose.md has been added, which allows for quick viewing of the data table.

## Blood glucose
Glucose is a 6-carbon structure with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Carbohydrates are ubiquitous energy sources for all organisms in the world and are essential for fueling aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration in simple and complex molecular forms [1]. Therefore, their role in energy production and their importance for various daily bodily functions are crucial for maintaining healthy blood glucose levels.

Although the body requires moderate amounts of glucose, the presence of excessively high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia) levels in the blood can significantly increase the risk of serious health complications, leading to a life-threatening disorder called diabetic coma that causes loss of consciousness.
